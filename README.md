# Hangman Game
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. Players attempt to guess the hidden word before running out of lives.

## How to Play
1. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
2. A word will be randomly chosen from the word list, and the game will start.
3. Guess letters one by one to uncover the hidden word.
4. Each incorrect guess will result in a hangman stage being displayed.
5. Guess the word before running out of lives to win the game.

## Example Usage
